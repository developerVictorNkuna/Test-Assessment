# Manual Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the plan and test cases for manual testing using **MS Excel**. The test cases will be designed based on the website mentioned in the Automation Assessment. Test scenarios are created independently, focusing on what should be tested to ensure quality and functionality.

## Scope
- Plan and document test cases manually.
- Identify and test key scenarios.
- Execute tests and track results using MS Excel.

## Tools
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for documenting test cases and tracking execution results.
- **Website from Automation Assessment**: The primary system under test.

## Test Plan
1. **Identify Test Scenarios**:
   - Explore the website and define testable functionalities.
   - Consider edge cases and boundary conditions.
2. **Design Test Cases**:
   - Write clear and concise manual test cases in MS Excel.
   - Define test steps, expected results, and actual results.
3. **Test Execution**:
   - Execute test cases based on priority and coverage.
   - Document any defects found during testing.
4. **Reporting**:
   - Track pass/fail status in the Excel sheet.
   - Summarize findings for review.

## Test Case Structure
Each test case should include:
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for the test case.
- **Test Scenario**: A brief description of what is being tested.
- **Preconditions**: Any setup required before execution.
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step actions to perform.
- **Expected Result**: The anticipated outcome of the test.
- **Actual Result**: The observed outcome after execution.
- **Status**: Pass/Fail based on comparison with the expected result.

## Deliverables
- **MS Excel File** containing all test cases and execution results.
- **Defect Report** (if applicable) documenting any issues found.

## Notes
- Ensure thorough documentation of all test scenarios.
- Regularly update test cases based on feedback or additional findings.
- Validate all major functionalities before concluding testing.
